# Python_translator

This code does the following:
For the source code (only in Python), its tabular representation is created in .csv files. The first file stores all the functions from the code (function name, parameters and the body of the function itself). The second file stores the variables (their name and their value).
In this code you can work with tables, the following functions are implemented:
1. table reading
2. read record
3. search for an entry by keyword
4. deleting an entry
5. editing a post

In the main.py file you can insert your own code for which you need to create a table view.

Before work, install the modules ast and csv.
